# Requirements and Installation

## Download caRpools

CaRpools is avaible as an R package **caRpools** without the scripts and template files.  
The complete package with the PERL scripts and all template files can be obtained from [Github](https://github.com/boutroslab/carpools) (https://github.com/boutroslab/carpools) and our website [crispr-analyzer.de](http://www.crispr-analyzer.org).  

We recommend to download the template files and Scripts from Github and install caRpools in R using the package installer `install.packages("caRpools").

## Virtual Box Image - The FAST-track

We also included a VirtualBox Image that already includes all necessary software and package files. 
**In this case no additional software to Virtual Box 5 needs to be installed.**  
You just need to install VirtualBox 5 from the [Website](https://www.virtualbox.org).  

You can then download the caRpools virtual box image from our website [crispr-analyzer.de](http://www.crispr-analyzer.de) or [Github](https://github.com/boutroslab/carpools) (https://github.com/boutroslab/carpools).  

### How to use the Virtual Box caRpools

## Hardware Requirements

For CRISPR-Libraries of 12 K size (12K sgRNAs), caRpools will work on any laptop/PC with at least 4GB of RAM and a modern dual-core CPU.  
CRISPR-Libraries with a size of more than 100 K (100 K sgRNAs) run best with at least 8 GB of RAM.

## Software Requirements

* R-Studio [Website](http://www.rstudio.com) (GUI)

The following **R packages** need be installed (can be done via `load.packages()`):

* Bioconductor Basics
    + BiocInstaller >= 1.18.3
    + BiocGenerics >= 0.14.0
* __biomaRt >=2.24.0__

## BiomaRt and Annotation Requirements

__Please note that for any annotation, biomaRt needs full access to the internet.__
In case of incorrect proxy settings, the report generation will fail with a biomaRt error.  
This means that if any proxy server is used, this has to be configured before using the CRISPR-Analyzer as described in the following articles:  

* [BiomaRt vignette](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/biomaRt/inst/doc/biomaRt.pdf)
* [Setting up proxy in R-Studio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200488488-Configuring-R-to-Use-an-HTTP-Proxy)
* [Setting up proxy in R, Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6467277/proxy-setting-for-r)
* [Setting up Proxy for R/R-Studio in Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/572722/setting-up-the-proxy-for-rstudio)
